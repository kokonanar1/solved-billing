<p class="ui header product-top-header" title="Class named Billing">Create a class named Billing that includes four overloaded computeBill() methods for a photo book store.

•  When computeBill() receives a single parameter, it represents the price of one photo book ordered. Add 8.5% tax, and return the total due.•  When computeBill() receives two parameters, they represent the price of a photo book and the quantity ordered. Multiply the two values, add 8.5% tax and return the total due.•  When computeBill() receives three parameters, they represent the price of a photo book, the quantity ordered, and a coupon value. Multiply the quantity and price, reduce the result by the coupon value, and then add 8.5% tax and return the total due.•  When computeBill () receives four parameters, they represent the price of a photo book, the quantity ordered, a coupon value, and a weekly discount. Multiply the quantity and price, reduce the result by the coupon value plus the weekly discount, and then add 8.5% tax and return the total due.
